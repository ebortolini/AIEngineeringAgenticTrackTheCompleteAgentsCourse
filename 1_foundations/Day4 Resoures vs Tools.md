# Resources vs Tools

## Resources

We can provide an LLM with resources to improve its expertise.
Basically, this just means shoving data relevant to the question into the prompt.

There are techniques like RAG to get really smart at picking relevant content.

## Tools

Give LLMs autonomy.

Give an LLM the power to carry out atcions like query a database or message other LLMs.
